# Algobench-20-21

Open `online/algorithms` in IntelliJ and run AlgoBench

Connect to localhost:8080

If running experiments doesn't work, make sure the path to the backend in Run Configurations is correct and that the backend file exists

To compile a new backend:
```
$ cd backend/build
$ cmake ../source && make
```
